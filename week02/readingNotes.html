    <h2>Reading Notes </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A function is a block of code that can perform tasks when invorked. function is more like a small self-contained mini program. Most functions have names and are invorked by calling them using their names and parenthersies.  </li>
        <li>It is a best practice to use the DRY(Don't Repeate Yourself). it is a principle of programming that evry part of  a program should only be written once, because it avoids duplicattions.</li>
        <li>All functions return values and can also recieve parameters and arguments which are passed into them</li>
        <li>functions are invoked at the top of the program regardless of where they are defined.</li>
        <li>functions are first class objects and behave the same way as other objects. this makes it easier to parse function into another function this is a practice called callbacks. </li>
        <li>Destructing Arrays - allows us to assign multiple values at the same time using arrays</li>
        <li>LOGIC statements are conditional statements that if it is met will cause a program to behave in a way</li>
        <li> WHILE LOOPS , any variable that is used by the loop must first be initialized before the loop runs. to avoid errors when it's mentioned</li>
        <li>do....while loops allows a block of code to run regardless of the condition being true or not</li>
        <li>for loops are the easiest and clearest loops to mine opinion</li>
        <li>Variables - const is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value and "Let" is used when the variable will be assigned later . </li>
        <li>when you use 'const' to declare an oblect the value of the object can be changed(mutate) but when you use 'const' to declare an object you can't reassign it to another object</li>
        <li>Scope refers to where a constatnt or variable  is accessible by a program</li>
        <li>Global scopes is any variable that is declared outside a block, it means it is accessible anywhere in the program. it is wise to limti the use of global scopes</li>
        <li>Local scope is any variable defined inside a block using 'const' or 'let'. it will be accessible only in the block but can't be accesed outside</li>
    </ul>
