    <h2>Reading Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditionally, when a form was submitted, it would be sent to a server where the information would be processed using a 'back end' language such as PHP or Ruby. It’s possible, and becoming more and more common, to process the information in a form on the 'front end' before it is sent to the server using JavaScript, which is what we’ll be focusing on in this chapter.</li>
        <li>To access a form using DOM we need to use the "document.forms" property.</li>
        <li>The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server</li>
        <li>Possibly the most important form event is the submit event, occurring when the form is submitted. Usually this will send the content of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept the form before it’s sent by adding a submit event listener. Add the following code to the main.js file</li>
        <li>Text input element objects have a value property that can be used to retrieve the text inside the field.</li>
        <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods</li>
