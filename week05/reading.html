    <h2>Reading Notes </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> There are bically three types of errors, which are system, programmer and user errors. </li>
        <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</li>
        <li>stack traces will always lead us to the where the error ocured</li>
        <li>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. </li>
        <li>it is important to test and debuge to make sure all erros are corrected beforethe user get the program</li>
        <li>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always where it originated, so you’ll need to run through the program to see what’s happening at different stages of its execution</li>
        <li>Most modern JavaScript environments have a console object that provides a number of methods for logging information and debugging. It's not officially part of the ECMAScript specification, but is well supported in all the major browsers and Node.js.</li>
        <li>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function, like so</li>
        <li>they are three ways to handle exceptions try, catch and finally.</li>
        <li>Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.</li>
        <li>Jest It makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.</li>
