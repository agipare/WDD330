    <ul>
        <li>In a browser environment the global object is the window object,
            which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</li>
            <li>Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe
                has a window object.</li>
                <li>Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser
                    environment, the global object is the window object. This means that any global
                    variable created is actually a property of the window object. </li>
                    <li>The Navigator object contains information about the browser
                        being used. Its userAgent property will return information about the browser and
                        operating system being used.</li>
                    <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the
                        URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide
                        information about different fragments of the URL</li>
                        <li>browser history property is use to show browsing history example like, number of pages visited,move to specific pages like using the browser forwad and back button</li>
                        <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the clientâ€™s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for storing information about users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions.</li>

                        <li>Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript. The idea is that any processes that could take a long time are carried out in the background, so a website will continue to function without fear of the dreaded 'script has become unresponsive' message that occurs when a script runs for too long, </li>
