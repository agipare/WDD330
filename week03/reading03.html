    <h2>Reading Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Objects are usually created to represent  real world entities like user orders,logins, logout</li>
        <li>Methods are functions stored in object properties. Methods allow objects to act like 'objects.doSomething' </li>
        <li>Method shorthands in all cases are always preferable</li>
        <li>Accessing information in an object using object method, you can use "this" keyword. Arrow functions don't have "this" because they are specail.</li>
        <li>Methods can reference the object as 'this'</li>
        <li>To cal[ an object method is the same as invoking a function</li>
        <li>The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.</li>
        <li> DOM  represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure.</li>
        <li>The DOM provides several methods that allow us to access any element on a page. These methods will return a node object or a node list, which is an array-like object. These objects can then be assigned to a variable and be inspected or modified.</li>
        <li>Append/appendchild is the function we use to add elementsto the DOM</li>
        <li>Append can be used to add strings and multiple things to a webpage but Appendchild can not</li>
        <li>text content will display all text as they are but innertext will display all text that are visible to us.</li>
        <li>Event listeners pernits us to be able to control the Dom using mouse clicks or keyboard. </li>
        <li>Bulbling works from the lowest to the highest and capturing works from highest to lowest </li>
    </ul>
